   <h2> A little bit about me </h2> 
   <p> I am originally from Valdosta Georgia. My senior year of high school my family relocated to 
    Warner Robins Georgia. There I graduated from Northside High School. I went on to attend Fisk University 
    from 2018-2020. After studying Political Science, I started a career in organizing and campainging. 
    I worked for The Equuity Alliance, a local bipartsian non profit organization, whose mission was to register voters in
    marginalized and surpressed communities. After the election of 2020 I went back to working in sales and marketing. 
    Since coming back into the field of sales and marketing, I've obtained a Real Estate license. I intend to buy, sell, and invest
    in real estate in Tennesse. I am currently working from home and enrolled in CodeX Learner's Front End Developer Cohort.  </p>
